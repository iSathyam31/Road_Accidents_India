# Road Accidents in India

This project explores road accident data in India from the years 2017 to 2019. Through exploratory data analysis using R, various aspects of road accidents are investigated to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors contributing to accidents.

## Introduction
Road accidents pose a significant challenge to public safety and infrastructure in India. Understanding the characteristics and underlying causes of accidents is crucial for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and road safety advocates. This project aims to analyze road accident data and identify key trends and insights to inform interventions and policy decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed information about road accidents reported in India from 2017 to 2019. It includes variables such as date and time of the accident, location (district/state), types of vehicles involved, road conditions, severity of injuries, and possible causes.

## Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset includes the following analyses:

**Temporal Trends:** Analysis of the number of accidents over the years, months, and days of the week to identify temporal patterns.
**Geographical Distribution:** Mapping the distribution of accidents across different states and regions in India.
**Vehicle Types:** Examining the types of vehicles involved in accidents and their contribution to the overall accident rate.
**Injury Severity:** Investigating the severity of injuries resulting from accidents and identifying common types of injuries.
**Factors Contributing to Accidents:** Exploring factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day that contribute to accidents.

## Visualizations
Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding complex data patterns. The project includes various visualizations such as:

Bar charts and pie charts illustrating the distribution of accidents by state, vehicle type, and injury severity.
Heatmaps displaying the spatial distribution of accidents across different regions in India.
Dependencies
The following R packages are used in this project:

ggplot2: For creating visually appealing plots and charts.
dplyr: For data manipulation and summarization.
leaflet: For interactive mapping and visualization.
tidyr: For data tidying and reshaping.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the analysis, identifying new insights, or adding new visualizations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
